jquery.addText.js
=================

A small jQuery plugin that adds a percentage of dummy text to existing text.

## Usage
Pretty simple: 

    $('p').addText();


## Example

**Original Text: **

In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum[1] is placeholder text (filler text) commonly used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout, by removing the distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning and not proper Latin.

** Modified Text: **

In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum[1] is placeholder text (filler text) commonly used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout, by removing the distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning and not proper Latin. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin egestas posuere laoree
